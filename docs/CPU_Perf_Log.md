# CPU performance mission — change log (branch `cpu-enhancements`)

Running log of every change made to close the ~1.33x gap to a physical Mac LC
(scoreboard: `docs/Speedometer_3-23_Benchmarks.md`, mission brief:
`docs/CPU_Improvements_Prompt.md`). **Kept deliberately precise because these
changes will be ported to the Pocket core** — each entry names the files, the
exact mechanism, and whether the change is core RTL (ports) or MiSTer-top glue
(re-derive per platform).

## The timing model (derived 2026-08-17, before any change)

Worth recording once, since every fix argues against it. All counts in
`clk_sys` (32.5 MHz) ticks; the CPU sees phi1/phi2 on alternating ticks
(16.25 MHz), and `addrController_top.v` rotates 4-tick bus slots
(`busCycle` 0..3; slots 3,0,1 = CPU, slot 2 = floppy; `busPhase` 0..3 within a
slot; `memoryLatch` = busPhase 3).

**CPU FSM** (`rtl/tg68k/tg68k.v` `s_state`, one step per tick): after the
kernel-clock edge (clkena, s7@phi1) the sequence runs s0, s1@phi1 (AS+RW
assert), s2, s3@phi1 (write strobes), s4@phi2 (DTACK/VPA/BERR sample — holds
here, re-checks every phi2), s5, s6@phi2 (din latch + AS/strobe release),
s7@phi1 (clkena). Zero-wait period = **8 ticks**.

**DTACK** (`MacLC.sv` / `verilator/sim.v` `dtack_en`): RAM/ROM/VRAM get DTACK
only at the busPhase-0 tick of a CPU slot (`cpuBusControl & mem_latch_d`)
while AS is low; peripherals/unmapped get it the tick after AS falls.

**SDRAM** (`rtl/sdram.v`): 8-state machine at clk_64 (65 MHz) hard-locked to
the slot (t wraps at the clk8 edge). Requests sampled ONLY at t==0 (= slot
start, busPhase 0); CAS at t==2; `dout` registered at t==6 → data is stable
during busPhase 3, and `dataController_top.sv` registers it into `cpu_data`
at `memoryLatch` (passthrough on that tick). Idle slots issue AUTO_REFRESH.
`sdram_oe` also fires for `dskReadAckInt/Ext` — the floppy slot reads SDRAM
every rotation whether or not a fetch is pending, and overwrites `dout`
(harmless today only because `cpu_data` snapshots at the granting slot).

**Consequence — the mod-4 floor.** A memory access can only *start* at a
slot-start tick and only *complete* 3 ticks later, so in a locked stream the
clkena-to-clkena period is forced to a multiple of 4 ticks; the loop latency
(clkena → addr → AS → strobe ≥ 3 ticks, data +3, consume +1) makes 4
impossible, so the floor is **8 ticks = 4 CPU clocks per access — exactly the
68000-style cycle we measured**, independent of how short the CPU FSM is.
Misalignment (clkena landing on busPhase 2) gives 10; the floppy slot in the
strobe position gives +4 (12). Internal kernel steps (busstate==01) clock at
phi1 only = 2 ticks each, and shift the alignment parity.
A real LC's 68020 does 3 clocks = 6 of our ticks (185 ns vs our 246+ ns).
⇒ **FSM-only shortening cannot beat 8 on SDRAM targets. Reaching 6 requires
starting the SDRAM access on demand (any tick) instead of at slot starts.**
Bus arbitration (`br_n`/`bgack_n`) is tied off in both tops — dead logic, no
interaction to preserve.

**Hard constraints discovered against the FPGA timing closure
(`MacLC.sdc`):**
1. The TG68 kernel carries a 2-cycle multicycle justified by "clkena can
   never pulse on two consecutive clk_sys cycles" — kernel reg→reg paths are
   ~33 ns, they do NOT close single-cycle at 32.5 MHz. Any wrapper rewrite
   must preserve **≥2 clk_sys between consecutive clkena pulses** (so 1-tick
   internal steps are off the table), and the SDC comment must be updated if
   the gating mechanism changes.
2. `tg68_din_r` is load-bearing for timing: it gives the kernel's deep
   data_in→decode cone a register boundary one tick before clkena. Feeding
   `tg68_din` combinationally into the kernel at the clkena edge would put
   SDRAM-mux→kernel-datapath in one 30.8 ns period — don't. Tail stays
   "din_r one tick before clkena".
3. `periph_din_reg`'s 2x multicycle assumes VPA reads settle ≥5 clk_sys
   before the sample — preserved as long as the VPA path keeps its current
   pacing (it must anyway).

## Plan of record

- **Phase A** — measure (sim-only instrumentation, this page's entry 1).
- **Phase B** — collapse the CPU FSM (short front/tail, 1-tick internal
  steps), reclaim the idle floppy slot for the CPU. Bounded gain (harvests
  the 10/12-tick cases + halves internal steps); prerequisite for C.
- **Phase C** — demand-start SDRAM service for CPU accesses (+ floppy request
  arbiter + refresh scheduling). This is where 8 → 6 lives.
- **Phase D** — CPU VRAM *reads* from `vram_bram` port A (writes already go
  to BRAM; reads still round-trip SDRAM today).

Gates for any phase: tb_gcr_read (+acclen=40 +pollgap=40, and a reduced
pollgap to model the faster CPU), tb_mfm_idcensus, tb_ism_sony, tb_disk_swap,
tb_scsi_pf, tb_scc_midi, check_boot.sh --run, quartus_map A&E, per-seed HW
video+boot gate. Floppy TB re-runs are non-negotiable for anything that
changes AS width or CPU pacing (the GCR latch-clear and Sony driver timing
are calibrated against current pacing).

### ★★★★★ MISSION CLOSED (2026-08-19 pm): 97.0% of a real Mac LC

**RELEASED `MacLC_20260819.rbf` = md5 `65332d3b736756199d7c4c8351276bde`**
(seed 4, STA +0.251; commit 7a49327 + user's 9cbf1a5). Mix **3.591** /
colour **1.179** — user-measured; six of twelve tests beat the physical
machine. The final defect (the SEVENTH of the mission): the first cache-on
benchmark showed software-FP tests 4-6% BELOW cache-off — **every hit
abandoned its already-launched demand transaction and the next access
stalled behind the phantom**. Fix: `hit_now` (fetch_cache) — a per-access
snapshot verdict gates the request in both tops, so **a hit never starts
an SDRAM transaction**. Fingerprint for the future: tight loops up +
FP/data-heavy down in the same run = an abandoned-transaction stall.
Full numbers + history: `docs/Speedometer_3-23_Benchmarks.md`.
Unreproduced one-shot, logged not closed: a single floppy-boot Sad Mac
($0F/$29) on the first 65332d3b boot — same image then booted the sim 600
frames clean (cache on) and other disks boot on HW; treat any recurrence
as new evidence, not confirmation. Residual gap: Sieve 67.6% / Queens
86.2% — working sets that defeat 1 KB direct-mapped word-granular; a
lined/larger cache or prefetch overlap is the next-mission shape.

### 7 — 2026-08-19: I-cache HW hang ROOT-CAUSED offline — abandoned-transaction stale-done in rtl/sdram.v

**The defect (proven, not theorised).** A fetch-cache hit answers the CPU
early: `icache_hit` drives `_cpuDTACK` directly, the FSM exits S_WAIT at
~tick 2 and releases AS at tick 4 — **abandoning the demand-start SDRAM
transaction the fetch triggered**. That breaks the Phase C handshake's
implicit invariant, which cache-off preserves by protocol: *the requester
always sits in S_WAIT until its own done, so a done can never outlive the
request that started it.* Two pre-existing properties then combine:

1. `cpu_done`'s early-done set (`seq == STATE_CMD_CONT+1`) is written AFTER
   the `!(oe||we)` clear in the same always block — **the set wins the
   same-edge conflict**, so a done can be born after its request level died.
2. The abandoned transaction's ACTIVE can be **delayed** — a floppy fetch
   window occupies the sequencer for 8 clk_64, a download word for the same,
   refresh for 5 — pushing it right up to the request level's drop edge.
   ACTIVE at the drop edge ⇒ early-done 3 clk_64 later, which lands **inside
   the NEXT bus cycle's S_WAIT sampling window**: a false DTACK, and the CPU
   latches the PREVIOUS access's `cpu_dout`. Executed garbage ⇒ the hang.
   (A write falsely completed the same way can be LOST outright if another
   window delays its re-arm past the level drop.)

Same stale-done family as the 2026-08-17 oe-bridge magenta bug and the
2026-08-18 download-ack floppy-mount bomb; this is the shared-mux law's
**fifth instance** — the cache is a fourth bus agent, and the hit bypass
removed the only thing that made `cpu_done` single-consumer.

**Why every offline gate passed.** The whole sim stack runs `sim_ram.v`,
never `rtl/sdram.v` — and sim_ram's handshake is structurally immune three
ways: its `!(oe||we)` clear is FIRST in an else-if chain (clear wins), its
set only fires while the level is high, and it has no delayed-start
mechanism at all (fixed 2-edge reads, floppy serves in parallel). The
controller whose handshake hangs the machine had never executed one cycle
in simulation. On the 08-18 HW test the GCR encoder still free-ran with no
disk (`flp_present` landed 08-19), so window occupancy was cycling
constantly — the delay source was live on every slot rotation, which is why
the hang was instant.

**The proof: `verilator/tb_icache_seam.v` (NEW)** — the REAL `rtl/sdram.v`
under Verilator (via a TB-only `TB_NO_TRISTATE` pin split; the procedural
tristate is why sim_ram exists), driven with the exact Phase-B bus shapes:
clk_sys-aligned level requests on the DUT's own t[0] parity lattice, a
behavioural SDRAM chip, and a hit cycle = a 4-tick oe level abandoned
unconsumed. Sweeps floppy-window (± its 4-tick guard) and download
occupancy phases past the abandoned fetch. Pre-fix: **3 stale-done
violations** (window, window+guard, download — all at the occupancy phase
that parks ACTIVE on the drop edge), each showing the next read would latch
the previous access's data. No-occupancy control clean, matching the
tick arithmetic (undelayed abandonment self-drains).

**The fix (`rtl/sdram.v`): done may only be born while its request level is
still up** — `&& oe` on the early-done set. `oe` alone, not `(oe||we)`: a
newly-risen WRITE level must not legitimise a stale READ's done. Cache-off
behaviour is untouched (the FSM's own wait guarantees the level at set
time). Ships with a `SDRAM_NO_DONE_LEVEL_FIX` negative control ifdef, per
the house differential pattern.

**Differential results:** fixed = PASS (107 checks, 0 violations, legit
read/write protocol + data all clean). Negative control = FAIL with exactly
the 3 violations. tb_dl_cpu_seam PASS / legacy-mux FAIL; tb_fetch_cache
PASS / hostile-RDW PASS / no-rdw-fix FAIL; quartus_map A&S 0 errors.

**Status: ★★★ HARDWARE-VALIDATED 2026-08-19.** Test fit **md5
`fb8819d6064194c2861b5f16560874d9`** (STA met +0.246 ns) with
`.enable(1'b1)` hardwired (no OSD navigation — the 08-19 row-11/row-12
toggle ambiguity is what the hardwire exists to avoid):
- **Boots to the full Finder desktop with the cache enabled** — the exact
  configuration that froze instantly on 08-18.
- Cursor-move liveness PASS (two frames differ).
- **Floppy-mount stress PASS**: OSD-mounted `Fetch GCR800K.dsk` into the
  running cached guest (screenshot-filename oracle confirms the download);
  the Finder auto-opened the disk window listing `Fetch 2.1.2 / 482K /
  application` — an HFS catalog B-tree read off the floppy, i.e. download
  occupancy + gen flush + windows-vs-hits interleaving all exercised, the
  precise trigger geometry of the original hang.
The RDW fix (entry 6) remains necessary — this was a SECOND, independent
defect; do not fold them.

**RELEASED 2026-08-19 as `releases/MacLC_20260819.rbf`** (= hash-named
`MacLC_dea3649e.rbf`, md5 `dea3649e1b9e81e3135b5cc558d244b2`, seed 5, STA
met +0.189 ns). Release shape per user ruling: **I-cache ALWAYS ON, no OSD
toggle** (CONF_STR row deleted, status[11] freed — the OSD map shifts:
MT32-pi=12, NMI=13, R6=14, R0=15). Seed lottery on this netlist: seed 4
drew −0.389 hold on sdram_addr_q→col_q (the known request-bundle class),
seed 7 drew −0.036 hold on a cd_audio MLAB — both migrating-victim
placement losses, neither in the new logic. Gates on dea3649e: 2× cold
boot to colour desktop (near-identical frames), cursor liveness, colour
icons clean, clean Shut Down choreography, .nvr byte-identical through
the full boot/shutdown/boot cycle. Still owed: the user's Speedometer
re-run (expect Sieve 53.7% / Queens 72.3% / Bubble Sort 74.4% to move
most).

**Same-day field report — the FULL story (superseding the first R6-only
theory).** "colors + 32-bit addressing reset every boot / settings don't
stick" decomposed into THREE stacked facts, established in this order:
1. The PRAM write/mirror path is HEALTHY — proven by the new SIMULATION
   witness in `egret_wrapper.sv` (zero-seed boot: the ROM's validity
   writes land in the canonical pram[]; warm framework reset via
   `--reset-at-frame`: boot-copy re-runs, pram[] survives — R0 "Reset &
   Apply" exonerated by experiment).
2. **★★★ The guest SOFT-RESTART (Special ▸ Restart) HANGS at a flat grey
   screen — deterministic (2/2 on the release), and LONG-STANDING: byte-
   identical signature on `MacLC_20260815.rbf`, `MacLC_20260817.rbf`, and
   `dea3649e`** (user concurs it may never have worked on this core).
   All reproductions ran from the MacAtrium volume (first bootable SCSI
   ID in the current mount set); the 08-08 "warm restart fixed, 3/3"
   validation used a DIFFERENT volume set/System — whether the 6.0.8
   System warm-restarts clean today is UNTESTED (cold boots always work).
   OPEN INVESTIGATION for a follow-up session. Evidence set:
   `scratch/after_restart*.png`, `b0815/b0817_after_restart*.png` (all
   mean 127.0 / std 0.0), the Special-menu choreography in this session's
   transcript, and the post-restart .nvr `37634172…` showing the OS's
   legitimate shutdown-time PRAM writes (mirror healthy through restart).
3. The user-facing loss mechanism: flush-on-OSD-open-only + routine hard
   recovery from the hang = recent settings discarded. **FIXED by
   `fc45705` (eager NVRAM persistence): every firmware PRAM write
   restarts a ~2 s settle timer; expiry flushes the sector if dirty.**
   OS write bursts coalesce; OSD-open flush retained; R6 unchanged.
   The all-zero .nvr files were R6/P_CLR — but NOT via mis-navigation:
   **the bench Main has a FIRE/RENDER OFF-BY-ONE for every row below the
   `P1,MT32-pi;` page header** (the cursor lands on the header as a
   selectable row; the action lookup skips it, so each row below fires
   the entry ABOVE its label). The user VISUALLY selecting "Reset &
   Apply" fired the wipe above it — twice; after a reorder put R5 there,
   the same selection fired the Interrupt (user report, the decisive
   clue). Long-standing and invisible until the R rows became
   load-bearing today; every row above the header always fired true.
   FIX `585334b`: the whole R block moved ABOVE the P1 header (labels
   fire true under the skew model, and it is the exact historical order
   if that model is wrong). VERIFIED by count-probe on the final build
   `5db08dda` (seed 4; seed 7 drew displaced+chroma-corrupt video —
   rejected by the video-first gate): firing "Reset & Apply" captured
   "Welcome to Macintosh" at t+12 s and the desktop at t+97 s with the
   .nvr intact. ★LAW for this core: never place actionable CONF_STR rows
   below a P-page header, and verify layout changes by firing a row and
   observing the guest, never by reading the rendered menu.
Bench-verification contract for the eager flush: deploy → cold boot →
touch NOTHING → the .nvr md5 must change within ~30 s (the ROM/OS boot
writes alone must trigger a flush), then a guest settings change must
appear in the file without any OSD open.

### ★★ RESOLVED (2026-08-19): floppy mount AND read both work again

Shipping candidate **md5 `e06be0ce9de18dc17866d519d7c73695`**, STA met
**+0.185 ns**, branch `cpu-icache`.

Hardware evidence:
- `Fetch GCR800K.dsk` mounts and the Finder auto-opens its window listing
  `Fetch 2.1.2 / 482K / application` — byte-identical to what the pre-mission
  `releases/MacLC_20260815.rbf` shows. That listing is an HFS catalog B-tree
  **read off the disk**, so reads genuinely work, not just the mount.
- `OS608-1440k.dsk` (1.44 MB MFM) no longer raises the "This disk is
  unreadable" dialog it reliably produced on the previous build.
- Boots to the Finder clean; the guest stays healthy through mounts.

Offline gate restored: `check_boot.sh` on a run with `--mount-floppy0-at 60`
now reports **PASS** (ROM early init, main startup, hardware init and RAM test
all reached, ADVANCING). Before the sim fixes below it reported "never reached
ROM init", with the CPU looping at PC `$1-$F` fetching `$FFFF`.

**Four defects, one root pattern.** Phase C's demand-start removed the slot
alignment that made every CPU-vs-non-CPU mux safe *by construction*. Each
shared resource then had to be separated, and each only became visible once the
previous was fixed:

| # | Shared resource | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | request nets + `cpu_done` | mount **bombs** the guest | dedicated `dl_*` download port |
| 2 | `memoryAddr` + data strobes | mount **freezes** guest, sprayed framebuffer | suppress floppy windows at source during a download |
| 3 | `sdram_do` → `cpuDataOut` | **boot hangs** once windows fire every rotation | floppy byte gets its own `dskReadDataIn` wire |

Plus the functional one: Phase C's `flp_pend_*` gate delivers **one** ack per
address change where `floppy.v`'s MFM loop needs **two per byte**
(`mfm_ack_skip` absorbs the in-flight one). Gate reverted.

**Perf debt — identified, and paid back.** With windows ungated, `flp_guard`
asserts on 2 of every 4 rotations (busCycle 01+10), costing the CPU roughly a
quarter of its start opportunities. The GCR encoder free-runs even with no disk
inserted, so every SCSI-only boot — and every benchmark run — was paying that
for fetches nobody reads.

Fix: `addrController` gains an `flp_present` input (`dsk_int_ins | dsk_ext_ins`)
folded into `flp_ok`, so windows and their guard exist only while a floppy is
actually mounted. Deliberately keyed on *a disk is present* rather than *the
motor is spinning*: with a floppy mounted the behaviour stays byte-for-byte
identical to the configuration validated above, and the bandwidth is reclaimed
only where the floppy path is provably idle. (A motor gate would be tighter but
would change timing under an active drive — the exact path that has now bitten
four times.)

**Measured, same sim harness, 100 frames with a mid-run mount at frame 60:**

| build | instructions retired in 100 frames |
|---|---|
| windows always on | 4,370,487 |
| windows gated on `flp_present` | **5,130,293** (+17.4%) |

Both runs `check_boot` PASS (ROM init / main startup / hardware init / RAM test,
ADVANCING). Speedometer should still be re-run on hardware before this is
stamped as a release.

**Two sim-only bugs introduced and fixed en route** (both cost real time):
- `sim_ram.v` holds `reset` **high for the whole ROM download** (its
  write-commit path says so), so clearing the download ack in the reset branch
  deadlocks the load. `rtl/sdram.v` is immune — its `reset` is the init ladder.
- `sim/sim_bus.cpp` holds `ioctl_wr` **high as a level** while `ioctl_wait` is
  set — not the one-cycle pulse `hps_io` gives. So an `else if (ack)` clear is
  unreachable (deadlock), and keying the clear on the ack *level* leaves
  `ioctl_wait` at 0 for two clocks — SimBus presents a new word on every clock
  it sees 0, so every other word was skipped and the ROM landed half empty.
  Clear on the ack's **rising edge**.

Also worth knowing: a comment line beginning `// verilator/...` is parsed by
Verilator as a metacomment and fails the build; and verify RBF freshness by
**content**, not `ls` — md5 polls returned the previous build's hash for ~20
minutes after the artifact was written (drvfs caching).

### 9 — 2026-08-19: two more floppy defects the download fix uncovered

Entry 8 fixed the cause of the *bomb*. Deploying it revealed two further
defects on the same path — both of which the bomb had been hiding.

**9a — the floppy window and the download slot are the same slot.**
First hardware test of the download-port fix: the mount no longer bombed, but
the guest froze with a sprayed framebuffer. Removing the `download_cycle` mux
had exposed a second collision the mux was masking.

`extraBusControl == dioBusControl` — a floppy window and a download word want
the *same* bus slot. And a window does more than request a fetch: it switches
`memoryAddr` to the floppy image address and forces both data strobes. That is
safe only because a window *also* blocks CPU starts (`flp_win`/`flp_guard` in
the controller). But `flp_win` is deliberately suppressed during a download —
so nothing blocked the CPU, and with the address mux gone the CPU's own
request reached the controller **carrying the floppy address**. Reads returned
image bytes instead of guest memory; writes landed in the image. The GCR
encoder free-runs with no disk, so those windows fire continuously.

Fix: gate `dskReadAckInt`/`dskReadAckExt` **and** `flp_guard` on
`!dio_download` inside `addrController`, instead of only masking `flp_win` at
the top. One gate then keeps `memoryAddr`, the data strobes, `flp_win_any` and
the `sdram_do` source mux all consistent — during a download there is simply
no floppy window.

**9b — the pending gate halves the ack count the encoders need.**
With 9a in, the guest survives a mount cleanly (desktop intact, OS healthy)
and the symptom reduces to an ordinary "This disk is unreadable" dialog.

Two free measurements localised it before any further build:
- A **1.44 MB MFM** image fails *identically* — with the correct HD
  "Initialize" dialog, so media-type detection is fine. Failing across two
  completely different track encoders rules the encoders out and puts the
  defect in the shared fetch seam.
- The **download path is exonerated by construction**: the boot ROM streams
  through the very same new `dl_*` port, and the machine boots — which
  requires a byte-perfect 512 KB ROM in SDRAM.

That leaves the pending gate (entry 3), the only Phase C change to the floppy
path that is *functional* rather than timing-only. Its stated premise — "one
ack per address is precisely what the freshness protocol needs" — is wrong,
and `rtl/floppy.v` says so directly:

```verilog
// on every delivered byte:
mfm_fresh    <= 1'b0;
mfm_ack_skip <= 1'b1;     // the in-flight ack belongs to the address we just left
// ...and later:
if (dskReadAckD) begin
    if (mfm_ack_skip) mfm_ack_skip <= 1'b0;
    else              mfm_fresh    <= 1'b1;
end
```

That is **two acks per delivered byte** — one absorbed by the skip, one to arm
the next. The pending gate delivers exactly *one* ack per address change; the
skip eats it, `mfm_fresh` never sets, and delivery stalls at the loop's own
`// else: payload byte not fetched yet` branch. The GCR path leans on repeated
acks the same way: `if (dskReadAck) diskImageData <= dskReadDataEnc` re-samples
every rotation and picks up the value `dskReadDataLatch` settled on a previous
one. **Both encoders were written against the continuous every-rotation acks
this design provided before Phase C.**

Fix: windows fire every rotation again. The bandwidth argument for the gate is
void under demand-start — the CPU is served from any idle `clk_64` edge and
does not need that slot.

**Method note.** The two failed fixes of 2026-08-18 were reasoned from code
with no reproduction. What actually moved this forward was cheap measurement:
one hardware A/B against the pre-mission release (never previously run), one
fault-injected TB, and one free "does MFM fail too?" mount. Each cost minutes
and each eliminated a whole class of cause. The remaining suspects, if
anything still misbehaves, are `sdram_dskodd_q` (byte parity registered one
`clk_sys`, on a premise that is void because `flp_win` is passed
**unregistered** in both tops — `sdram_flpwin_q`/`ram_flpwin_q` are dead code)
and `cf9a98b` (`flp_addr` bypassing the request pipeline). The repo's own
hardware instrument for this, `USE_DBG_HUD` rows 7/8, is still unused.

**Timing arithmetic, recorded because it was expensive to derive.** `floppy.v`
samples `dskReadAckD` at `cen` (busPhase 1) and latches `dskReadDataLatch` at
`cep` — the edge *ending* busPhase 3 — of the same window slot. With `flp_win`
unregistered, ACTIVE fires around busPhase 0 and the controller assigns `dout`
at `seq == 6`, three `clk_sys` later, i.e. the start of busPhase 3: stable
across the whole phase, so the latch is correct. Registering `flp_win` would
push that capture to busPhase 0 of the *next* slot and deliver the previous
byte.

**Sim note.** Making `verilator/sim.v`'s download slot-gated (to match
`MacLC.sv`) makes the sim's ROM download **16× slower** — one word per bus
round instead of one per `ioctl_wr` tick, ~8 sim-frames instead of ~0.5. Not a
hang; budget for it. Also: `sim_ram.v` holds `reset` high for the entire ROM
download (its write-commit path says so), so never clear a download ack in its
reset branch.

**Pocket port:** 9a is core RTL (`addrController_top.v`) and applies to any
platform that shares the extra-slot scheme. 9b is core RTL too, and applies to
anyone who adopted Phase C's pending gate.

### 8 — 2026-08-18: ★ THE FLOPPY-MOUNT BOMB — root cause was the DOWNLOAD, not the floppy

**Symptom.** Mounting any floppy image bombed the running guest with
"illegal instruction" or "coprocessor not installed" — the executed-garbage
signature. Reproduced across multiple images, so not a bad image.

**The tell that cracked it.** Two *different* bomb IDs from the same
operation. A broken datapath fails the same way every time; random bomb IDs
mean random memory corruption. And a floppy that reads badly reports a disk
error (`-69`, "not a Macintosh disk") — it does not bomb the CPU. So the
corruption had to be hitting the *guest's own code*, during the download,
before any disk read was attempted.

**Root cause.** Pre-Phase-C, `_romOE` / `_ramOE` / `_ramWE` were gated on
`cpuBusControl` — the exact complement of `dioBusControl`. The CPU and the
image download could therefore never present a request at the same time:
**mutual exclusion by construction.** Phase C (entry 3, `f13d936`) deleted
that gating so the CPU's request became a LEVEL held for the whole AS-low
window — and that level spans the download's slot. Both tops still muxed the
download onto the CPU's own `addr`/`din`/`ds`/`we`/`oe` nets
(`download_cycle = dio_download && dioBusControl`), so:

1. While the mux pointed at the download, the CPU's request was **invisible**
   to the controller.
2. The download's posted-write ack landed in `cpu_done` — which *is* the
   CPU's DTACK (`_cpuDTACK = ~sdram_cpu_done`). When the slot ended and the
   CPU's still-asserted `oe` came back, `!(oe || we)` was never true, so
   `cpu_done` never cleared: **the CPU completed a read it had never issued
   and latched the previous access's `cpu_dout`.** Executing that stale word
   is the bomb.
3. Symmetrically, in slots where `dio_write` was low, `oe`/`we` were forced
   to 0, *clearing* a legitimate in-flight `cpu_done`.

This is the same class as the magenta bug (entry 4): **request-done must key
on the requester's own level, never on a shared mux.** That fix removed
`dskReadAck` from `oe` but left the download carrying the identical hazard.

**Why only mounts.** `MacLC.sv` holds the CPU in reset while
`(dio_download && dio_index == 0)`, so the boot ROM download is immune. Only
floppy mounts (`dio_index` 1/2) run with the guest live — which is exactly why
booting always worked and mounting always broke.

**Fix.** A dedicated download port on the memory controller:
`dl_req` (level, = `ioctl_wait`) / `dl_slot` (= `dioBusControl`) / `dl_addr` /
`dl_din` / `dl_ack`, ranked `flp > dl > cpu`, with `src_cpu = 0` so it can
never write `cpu_done`. The `download_cycle` mux is deleted from both tops —
including the `sdram_do = 16'hffff` term, which was the same defect in the
read direction (it corrupted any CPU read sampled inside a download slot).
Keeping the start gated on `dl_slot` preserves the pre-Phase-C rate of one
word per bus round, so the CPU/download bandwidth split is unchanged.

Two subtleties worth porting:
- **`ioctl_wait` now clears on `dl_ack`, not on the slot edge.** The old edge
  protocol assumed the write had certainly been issued by the end of the slot;
  under demand-start the sequencer can still be busy with a CPU access, and a
  word that missed its slot was **silently dropped from the image**.
- **`dl_ack` must be a LEVEL held until `dl_req` drops.** `clk_64` is 2x
  `clk_sys`, so a one-tick pulse is not reliably sampleable on the other side;
  releasing it on the *slot* instead hangs the download when the two just miss.

**Evidence — two independent proofs.** (Both earlier floppy fixes were
reasoned from code with no reproduction, and both failed on hardware. This
entry is deliberately the opposite.)

1. **Hardware A/B.** `releases/MacLC_20260815.rbf` (the tip before this
   mission) mounts `Fetch GCR800K.dsk` perfectly — volume mounts, window
   opens, `Fetch 2.1.2 / 482K / application` listed. The mission build bombs.
   So it is a genuine Phase B/C regression. **This test had never been run.**
2. **Fault injection.** `verilator/tb_dl_cpu_seam.v` drives CPU reads
   concurrently with a download. Against the fix: 10/10 reads correct, PASS.
   Rebuilt `+define+TB_LEGACY_MUX` (the pre-fix wiring, same DUT): **3/10
   reads return stale data**, FAIL — e.g. `read 100001 returned af80, expected
   a53d`. That is the bomb mechanism, deterministically, in seconds.

**New tooling this entry depends on.**
- `verilator/sim_main.cpp`: `--mount-floppy0-at <frame>` /
  `--mount-floppy1-at <frame>` defer the ioctl download to a chosen frame, so
  the sim can mount a floppy **with the guest live**. Every download used to be
  queued at startup with the CPU in reset — structurally unable to exercise
  this entire class of bug. This closes task #7's core gap.
- `verilator/tb_dl_cpu_seam.v` + `verilator/altddio_out_stub.v`. The TB targets
  `sim_ram.v` because **`rtl/sdram.v` cannot be Verilated** — it drives its
  `sd_data` tristate from a non-blocking procedural assignment, which Verilator
  5.x rejects. (That is why `sim_ram.v` exists at all.) The stub and an
  `iverilog` command line for running the same test against the real controller
  are in the TB header; Icarus is not installed in this WSL.

**Pocket port:** core RTL (`rtl/sdram.v` ports) **and** top-level glue
(`MacLC.sv`) — re-derive the glue per platform, but the port and the
`dl_ack`-driven `ioctl_wait` handshake carry over unchanged. Any platform that
kept a `download_cycle`-style mux while adopting Phase C has this bug.

### ★ CORRECTION (2026-08-18): the floppy fixes are REASONED, not REPRODUCED

The two floppy fixes below (entry 7) were motivated by hardware bombs seen
right after mounting a `MacPPP-2.0.1-dani` floppy image. **The user then
reported that that image is itself suspect**, so the symptom is NOT reliable
evidence and the bombs may never have been caused by these bugs at all.

What still stands on code analysis alone, independent of any image:
- **Stale-image serve** — the window gate skips a fetch whose address repeats,
  but mounting rewrites SDRAM at those addresses. A real hole; the fix
  (invalidate on download) is correct regardless.
- **One-tick data/latch skew** — `floppy.v` latches at busPhase 3 of the window
  slot while the Phase-C request pipeline pushed the data capture to busPhase 0
  of the next slot. The fix restores the pre-Phase-C relationship, i.e. it puts
  the floppy path back to behaviour that shipped for months. Conservative
  either way.

**Neither fix is confirmed against a reproduction.** To get a trustworthy
verdict use a known-good image — `Disk605.dsk` (also in `releases/`),
`Fetch GCR800K.dsk` (used in the validated 800K GCR work), or
`6.0.7 System Tools.dsk` — and check mount + catalog + a file read. Do not
judge the floppy path on `MacPPP-2.0.1-dani`.

★ The durable answer is the system-level media-change test (task #7): every
existing floppy TB instantiates the encoder/SWIM directly and never touches
`addrController` or the SDRAM controller, so this whole class of bug sits in an
untested seam and can only be judged by hand on hardware today.


### 6 — 2026-08-18: I-cache ported and HW-tested — WORKS IN SIM, HANGS ON HARDWARE

**Ported** `rtl/fetch_cache.sv` (branch `i-cache` @`b393eaf`) onto the Phase B+C
tree, branch `cpu-icache`. One correction was mandatory:

★ **The hit path needs an address valid one clk BEFORE AS falls.** The
pre-Phase-B walker gave that free (addr at s0, AS at s1); the Phase-B FSM
registers `addr` and asserts `as_n_r` on the SAME edge, so on the registered
address the module's correspondence guard (`rd_idx_d == idx`) rejects every
fetch — a 100% miss, silently. `tg68k.v` now exposes `addr_early` (the kernel's
combinational output) and the cache is fed from it.

**Everything offline says it is good:**
- Hit rate **99.96%** (3,998,471 / 4,000,000; 1,529 cold misses).
- Fetch cycle **8.00 → 6.00 ticks flat**; data reads unchanged at 8.00.
- `verilator/tb_fetch_cache.v` (NEW): coherency torture — self-modifying code,
  zero-gap write/fetch, index aliasing, generation flush, 256-iteration
  interleave. **958 hit-data checks, zero violations.**
- `scripts/icache_trace_diff.py` (NEW): cache-ON vs cache-OFF PC→opcode
  identity. PASS — but weak: the diskless sim runs 5.2M instructions across only
  ~1,000 distinct PCs.
- Sim BOOTS with the cache enabled (5.3M instructions, no hang).
- Fit clean: setup +0.330 / hold +0.242 design-wide; RAM 503 → 506 blocks.
- STA probe on the cache's own paths: worst **+3.326 ns** in, +20 ns out,
  +0.424 ns hold. Nothing like the −6.710 ns Phase C was hiding.

**★★★ AND YET: enabling it on hardware HANGS the machine.** Deployed
(md5 5331d64e), booted with the switch off — Speedometer matched the release
within noise (mix 3.048 vs 3.067, colour 1.029 vs 1.030), confirming the gate
isolates the answer path. Flipping **CPU I-Cache → Enabled** mid-session froze
the guest: screen pixel-identical after cursor movement (the definitive liveness
oracle here, since the menubar clock is frozen anyway). No Sad Mac, no bomb — a
HANG, which reads as the CPU spinning on garbage rather than faulting. Recovered
by reloading the core; the volume booted fine and the pre-flip backup
(`MacLC_7-5-5.PRE-ICACHE-BACKUP.hda`) is intact and byte-verified.

**★ LEADING HYPOTHESIS — the July audit's margin was consumed by Phase B+C.**
The module header states the fill's M10K read-during-write garbage *"is provably
never consumed (next AS-fall ≥2 clk)"*. That guarantee came from the OLD 8-tick
cycle and its longer tail. Phase B+C compressed the cycle to 6 ticks with a
single-tick S_IDLE, so the distance from the fill (at AS-rise) to the next
fetch's AS-fall has SHRUNK. Supporting detail: `tag_ram`/`data_ram` are declared
`(* ramstyle = "M10K" *)` **without** `no_rw_check`, so their real
read-during-write behaviour need not match Verilog's non-blocking semantics —
exactly the class of thing simulation models ideally and silicon does not, which
is why every offline test passes.

**★ Fix direction (do this before trying hardware again):** stop relying on a
timing margin and make the cache RDW-immune by construction — detect
`write_index == read_index` in the same cycle and either force a miss or
bypass-forward the written data. Then extend `tb_fetch_cache.v` with an explicit
same-cycle fill-vs-lookup case (it does NOT currently cover that) and re-run
before refitting.

**Status: the cache ships OSD-gated OFF and is safe to deploy; do not enable it
on an image you care about until the above is done.**


### 2 — 2026-08-17: Phase B — collapsed bus FSM (tg68k wrapper) + DTACK-grant qualifier

**Core RTL (ports to Pocket): `rtl/tg68k/tg68k.v`.** The 8-state per-tick
walker (AS at s1-phi1, DTACK sampled only at s4-phi2, latch s6, clkena s7)
is replaced by S_IDLE/S_WAIT/S_TAIL1/S_TAIL2/S_ENDC:

- AS+RW+UDS/LDS assert at the first edge after the kernel presents the
  access (any phi phase) — one tick earlier than before, and write strobes
  now assert WITH AS (was: two ticks later at s3; safe because SDRAM samples
  ds two clk_64 into the granting slot and VPA targets are E-paced).
- S_WAIT samples exit EVERY tick: `berr_held | !dtack_n | (phi2 && xVma)`.
  The VPA exit keeps its phi2 qualification = E-pacing identical.
- Tail is tick-identical to the old walker: exit +2 = din_r latch +
  AS/strobe release (old s6), +3 = clkena (old s7). Slot-granted SDRAM data
  lands at the granting slot's busPhase-3 tick = exit+2 exactly.
- clkena = S_ENDC, plus internal (busstate==01) steps in S_IDLE gated by
  `!clkena_d` — preserves the ≥2-clk_sys kernel-update spacing the SDC
  multicycle needs (internal steps stay 2 ticks; they now phase-drift
  instead of phi1-locking, which breaks the 8-tick parity lock more often).
- berr_hold clears in S_IDLE (after the kernel's S_ENDC berr sample).
- E/VMA block untouched (its `s_state != 0` guard still works: S_IDLE==0).
- Instrumentation start/end conditions updated to the new states; target
  classifier fixed (32-bit $50Fxxxxx I/O aliases were landing in "other";
  only slot space $F1-$FE is genuinely non-24-bit).

**Top glue (re-derive per platform): `MacLC.sv` + `verilator/sim.v`** — the
mem-slot DTACK grant gains an `as_low_q` qualifier (AS low through the
whole previous tick). The SDRAM controller samples oe/we at the slot's
first clk_64 edge; the old FSM could never present AS at a slot boundary
(phi1-only assert), the new one can, and granting such a slot would serve
stale dout (the fill-capture hazard class from the MacIIvi 2026-08-16
lesson). No cost against old-FSM-timing cases.

**`MacLC.sdc`**: kernel-multicycle + periph_din_reg comment justifications
rewritten for the new gating (constraints themselves unchanged). Pocket
port: whatever the Pocket's timing constraints are, the same two invariants
must hold there — ≥2-cycle kernel spacing, and din_r/periph settle windows.

Expected effect (model): locked fetch streams stay at the 8-tick slot
floor; the 10/12-tick misalignment and transient cases compress toward
6-9; DTACK-immediate targets (slot space, SCSI-DMA when DREQ pending)
complete in 5-6 ticks vs 8. Measured effect: see entry 3.

**MEASURED (sim A/B, archived `scratch/bus_hist_phaseB.log`):** window-0
boot workload executed cycle-for-cycle identically to baseline (2,944,491
vs 2,944,483 cycles — functional transparency proven); ROM fetch stays
8.93 (the slot lock, as modeled), while the new fast paths appear exactly
where designed (IO-DTACK 5.0, RAM writes 6.0, len-5/6 buckets populated).
Desktop windows: fetch 8.60, VRAM read 9.50, VRAM write 10.10.

**HW gate 2026-08-17: PASS.** Fit seed 7: Fitter Successful, STA met
(worst slack +0.216 ns). Deployed md5 63982eb3b61e476e1259f14b15331bd3 as
canonical MacLC.rbf; coreRunning=MACLC; booted System 7.5 to the Finder
desktop with clean video and colour icons (scratch/phaseB_hw_boot1.png).

### 4 — 2026-08-18: Phase C FIX — pipeline the request bundle (branch `cpu-phase-c-fix`)

**The F-line bomb was a genuine timing failure, and STA proved it.** With the
`b48b60c` multicycle disabled, timing analysis on the post-fit netlist
reported:

```
slack -6.710 ns   WINDOW 15.381 ns   tg68k|addr[16] -> sdram|sd_addr[12]
```

The capture window is ONE clk_64 period (15.381 ns) — so the `t[0]` start gate
selects the half-period edges, not the coincident ones — while the V8
address-translation cone (SIMM compare, mirror subtract, mux) needs ~22 ns.
The demand sequencer was latching a **half-settled row/column address**, so
reads and writes landed at the wrong locations. That is the RAM corruption
behind the "System Update" error-type-10 (F-line) bomb: the guest eventually
executed garbage. The multicycle had been granting 2 destination periods
(30.76 ns) that the silicon never had — the textbook STA-met-but-HW-fails trap.

**Why Phase B never had this problem:** it did not touch `sdram.v`. The old
slot machine sampled at a fixed slot phase with the CPU holding address and
data stable across the WHOLE 4-clk_sys slot — about 123 ns of settling. Phase C
discarded that margin and replaced it with a promise in a constraint file.

**Fix (core RTL + both tops):** register the entire SDRAM request bundle in
clk_sys before it reaches the controller — `addr`, `din`, `ds`, `oe`, `we`,
`flp_win`, `flp_guard`, plus the floppy byte-parity select so it stays coherent
with the address it was issued with. The deep cone now terminates at a clk_sys
flop with a full 30.76 ns period (22 ns needed → genuine positive slack), and
the sequencer captures from an adjacent register over a short route. Both legs
are honest single-cycle paths STA actually checks. **The multicycle is deleted**
with a DO-NOT-RE-ADD note in `MacLC.sdc`.

**Verified:** SDRAM paths **−6.710 → +3.817 ns**; design-wide worst setup back
to the framework ascal at +0.424 ns. Sim boots clean (frame 450 = dither
desktop + cursor + flashing-? icon).

**Cost and result — one clk_sys tick of request latency:**

| | baseline | Phase B | Phase C (broken) | Phase C + fix |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| ROM fetch | 8.96 avg (75% at len 8) | 8.93 | 7.00 | **8.00 flat (100%)** |
| VRAM read | ~11.6 | 9.50 | 7.00 | **8.00** |
| VRAM write | ~10.1 | 10.10 | 6.00 | **7.00** |
| desktop cycles/sec | — | 3.20 M | 4.44 M | **3.59 M (+12% over Phase B)** |

The win is smaller than the broken build advertised (+12% vs +38%) but it is
real. **Everything is now FLAT** — 100% of fetches at exactly 8 ticks, versus a
baseline where only 75% hit the floor and the rest paid 10/12/14 for slot
misalignment. That flatness is the demand engine working as designed.

**Idea for Phase C2 (recovering the lost tick, 8 → 7):** translate the address
speculatively from the kernel's combinational `tg68_addr` and register THAT, so
the translated address is valid at the same edge AS asserts instead of one tick
later. Needs a timing check on the kernel-output cone, which is already long.

**★ HW GATE: PASS (2026-08-18 09:53).** Seed-4 fit (STA met, +0.149 ns, no
violations) deployed as canonical MacLC.rbf: the guest boots straight to the
System 7.5.5 Finder desktop with colour icons intact and NO bomb. The
"System Update" error-type-10 crash is gone. This closes the loop opened by
the 2026-08-17 failure: sim-clean + STA-clean + HW-clean, with the timing
proven rather than asserted. Speedometer re-run is the remaining step (expect
~+12% on the mix per the histogram; Phase B alone measured as noise).

**Seed note:** the seed-7 placement of this fix left an unrelated 19 ps HOLD
violation in the CD-audio MLAB write-address path (`cd_audio|t43_wa[5]` →
`cd_sdp_mlab` LUT-RAM address regs) — a module this change never touched,
exposed because any netlist edit re-rolls the unpinned RAMs. Refit on seed 4.
★ That is the LEGITIMATE use of a reseed (placement marginality on an unrelated
module); using one to make the address-path violation "pass" would have been
the illegitimate use, and is exactly what the deleted multicycle was doing.

### 3 — 2026-08-17: Phase C — demand-start SDRAM service (the slot-floor break)

**Core RTL (ports to Pocket): `rtl/sdram.v`** — the operational branch of
the command engine is a demand sequencer: an access starts at any idle
clk_64 edge (same 8-clk_64 ACTIVE/CAS/capture schedule as before,
including the +2 capture margin), instead of only at bus-slot boundaries.
New ports: `flp_win` (floppy window, priority, runs slot-aligned by
construction so floppy.v sees identical timing), `flp_guard` (hold CPU
starts while a pending floppy window approaches), `cpu_done` (early-done:
reads at ACTIVE+3 clk_64 — data lands in `cpu_dout` at ACTIVE+6, a full
tick before the FSM's exit+2 din_r latch; writes POSTED at ACTIVE),
`cpu_dout` (private held CPU read register — floppy windows can no longer
clobber CPU data). Request values (din/ds/column) freeze at ACTIVE
(din_q/ds_q/col_q) so mid-access mux flips (download windows) can't
corrupt a delayed access. CPU starts gated to t[0] parity (integer
clk_sys edges) so cpu_dout launches on full-period STA paths — no
cross-clock multicycle needed. Explicit refresh: opportunistic when idle
past REF_OPP (300 clk_64), forced past REF_FORCE (480) — tREF needs one
per ~508. Read period: 7 clk_sys; write period: 6 (vs 8/10/12 before).

**`rtl/addrController_top.v`**: `_ramOE/_romOE/_ramWE/_memoryUDS/LDS`
drop their `cpuBusControl` slot gating (they are now level requests;
floppy windows force read-both-bytes). `dskReadAckInt/Ext` are
PENDING-GATED (fire only when the encoder's fetch address changed since
last served — kills the every-rotation spurious SDRAM read; served state
marked at the window's memoryLatch). New outputs `flp_guard` (covers the
full slot before a pending window + the window), input `cpu_wr_ack`. The
VRAM BRAM write-mirror strobe (`vram_we`) fires on the RISING EDGE of
`cpu_wr_ack` instead of at cpuBusControl&&memoryLatch — under demand
serving an AS-low window need not contain a cpu-slot latch tick (silent
BRAM-write drop = stale pixels), while the ack rises mid-cycle when AS,
the live a_be strobes, address and data are all still held.

**Top glue (re-derive per platform): `MacLC.sv` + `verilator/sim.v`** —
`_cpuDTACK` mem leg = `~cpu_done` (dtack_en shrinks to the immediate
peripheral/unmapped path; the as_low_q slot qualifier from entry 2 is
gone with the slot grant itself). `sdram_do`'s CPU leg serves the held
`cpu_dout` (warm-boot ROM patch applied there); `sdram_out` remains the
floppy demux source. `rtl/dataController_top.sv`: the memory leg of
cpuDataOut passes `memoryDataIn` straight through (retired the
slot-sampled `cpu_data` register — upstream data is now held).

**`verilator/sim_ram.v`**: same handshake, latency-matched (reads done at
+2 edges, writes posted at +1) — plus the write path is `!flp_win`-gated:
with un-slotted `_ramWE`, a pending CPU write's `we` is high during
floppy windows while `addr` is the floppy image's (the FPGA controller is
safe by construction; the sim model needed the explicit gate).

**Bug found and fixed during bring-up (the magenta screen, 2026-08-17,
identical on HW and sim):** first Phase-C builds booted to a uniform
magenta instead of the desktop. Diagnosis chain: CPU healthy (check_boot
PASS, desktop workload executing), VRAM BRAM strobes healthy through
frame 240 (109,364 strobes = exactly the visible-column fraction, 0
missed), frame 200 healthy grey, frame 450 magenta — the break follows
the Sony driver install, whose drive polling churns the floppy fetch
address and fires pending windows continuously. Root cause: `sdram_oe`
still included `dskReadAckInt/Ext` (a slot-machine leftover), while
`cpu_done` clears on `!(oe||we)` — a floppy window bridging the 2-3 tick
AS-high gap between CPU cycles held oe high, so done never cleared: the
next READ instant-acked on the held done and latched the PREVIOUS
access's cpu_dout without touching SDRAM (stale-read class), and the
next WRITE lost its done-RISE, silently dropping the vram_we BRAM
strobe. Fix: `oe` is pure CPU/download read intent in both tops (floppy
intent travels only via flp_win; sim_ram's window serve drops its oe
qualifier). The magenta itself was the Ariel's reset-time diagnostic
palette (bin 5 = magenta) showing through — a deliberately loud init
pattern that made the failure visible and diagnosable; uniform color =
the System's post-mode-switch redraw lost to dropped strobes and stale
RMW reads. **Pocket port note: this is THE trap class for any port of
the demand engine — every request-done handshake must key on the
requester's OWN level, never on a mux shared with another master.**

**Magenta, act 2 (open at this writing):** the oe fix was real but not
sufficient — the screen persisted on the next build. Precision so far:
the visible "magenta" is the 1bpp B/W desktop dither rendered through
two mis-programmed CLUT entries — 0x7F = (7F,FF,7F) light green, 0xFF =
(7F,00,7F) dark magenta (pixel-counted from the HW screenshot: exactly
307,200 pixels split 50/50) — produced when the guest's final 2-entry
CLUT program is phase-shifted by ONE extra READ-decoded ariel access
after each of its writes (REG_PALETTE reads auto-advance the shared RGB
counter — semantics verified identical in MAME ariel.cpp, the model's
ground truth). The failing boot branch is selected by what the ROM's
video probe reads from UNWRITTEN memory, so Verilator's per-build
--x-initial fast pattern made instrumented rebuilds dodge the path;
sim_ram now deterministically fills mem[] (zeros → clean path; trying
FFFF). Next discriminator: the instruction stream between consecutive
DAC writes in a magenta run's cpu_trace.log — real guest reads of
$F24xxx (⇒ our readback DATA is wrong) vs none (⇒ fabricated bus
cycles). MAME reference sequence via the run_mame.sh rig if needed.

**Magenta RESOLVED — root cause: unanswered ROM-region WRITES.** The
trail in full: the shredded CLUT was a red herring — the Phase-B
baseline executes the IDENTICAL RMW-based B/W patch with the identical
transient shred (the RD/WR pairs are the read halves of BSET #7 /
NOT.B-class instructions on the DAC data port; the "reads" were real),
and then ~32 frames later the boot's next stage reprograms the full CLUT
correctly. Phase C never reached that stage: a bus-hang watchdog named
the stall — a byte WRITE to $A6C3D5, ROM space, issued by the ROM's
device-probe code behind a temporary vector-$8 handler. A ROM write
asserts neither oe (read-gated) nor we (RAM/VRAM-gated), so the demand
engine never serves it; the old slot glue acked every mem-region access
at the slot start REGARDLESS of oe/we — ack-and-discard, 68000/V8
style — which is what the ROM requires (ack or BERR; hang is the one
illegal outcome). Fix: ROM-region writes take the immediate dtack_en
path (ack-and-discard) in both tops; the demand leg serves
RAM/VRAM/ROM-reads only. The pre-oe-fix builds sometimes LOOKED alive
under magenta because the stale-done bug phantom-acked these writes —
two bugs stacked on one symptom. **Pocket port law #2: every access
class the memory engine does NOT serve must still be terminated
(ack-and-discard or BERR) — enumerate them (ROM writes are the classic)
before first boot.** Repro determinism: sim_ram mem[] init value picks
the ROM's probe branch; 16'hFFFF reproduces the failing (?-icon) path.

### 1 — 2026-08-17: Step-0 measurement instrumentation (sim-only) + BASELINE

- `rtl/tg68k/tg68k.v`: `ifdef SIMULATION` block — histograms every completed
  bus cycle's clkena-to-clkena tick count, binned by busstate
  (fetch/read/write) × target class (RAM/ROM/VRAM/VPA/IO-DTACK/other), plus
  internal-step counts; dumps `bus_hist.log` once per simulated second.
- `scripts/bus_hist_report.py`: aggregates/reports the log.
- **Pocket port: not needed** (measurement scaffolding only). The timing
  model above, however, applies wherever the same addrController/sdram slot
  scheme is used.

**BASELINE (pre-Phase-B commit `3568a1e`, 9 sim-seconds boot→desktop,
archived `scratch/bus_hist_baseline.log`):**

| phase | bus-cycle share | avg cycle | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| whole run (w0-6) | 86.6% of ticks | ~9.2 | ROM fetch 44.4% @ 8.96; RAM rd 17.5% @ 9.50; RAM wr 13.9% @ 10.03 |
| desktop (w6-8) | 86.5% of ticks | ~8.4 | ROM fetch 46.6% @ 8.41 (89.6% at len 8); VRAM/periph via $50Fxxxxx aliases: rd 26.5% @ 11.60, wr 17.3% @ 10.10 |

Memory-cycle length mix (whole run): only 57% (RAM) / 75% (ROM) of cycles
hit the 8-tick floor; the rest sit at 10/12/14 (slot misalignment + the
idle floppy slot). Internal steps are just 3-4% of ticks — the CPU's time
is essentially all bus cycles. Confirms: cut ticks-per-access or nothing.
(Caveat for A/B: this run predates the classifier fix, so 32-bit
$50Fxxxxx I/O/VRAM aliases count as "other" here.)
