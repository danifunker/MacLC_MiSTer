# Speedometer 3.23 — MacLC core vs physical hardware

Physical-hardware rows are the same reference set as
`docs/Speedometer_3-03_Benchmarks.md`, extended with the Performa 600 column
set from `MacIIvi_MiSTer/docs/Speedometer_3-23_Benchmarks.md` (that sheet also
carries its own core rows; this one is MacLC only).

**Core row provenance:** MacLC core on the bench, guest reports Mac LC /
MC68020 / no FPU / Mac II AMU / 10240K physical / ROM $067C 512K — an
apples-to-apples match for the physical Mac LC rows. Captured 2026-08-17 at
640x480; the capture does not stamp the RBF, so pin the build hash here when
known. **Provenance settled 2026-08-18:** this row predates the CPU-perf
mission entirely — the file arrived untracked and was first committed as
`cfd62ec`, when the branch tip was `a43d5e0` (the `MacLC_20260815.rbf`
release), so the build was almost certainly that release (inferred from the
tip, not stamped by the capture). Phase A of the mission was
`ifdef SIMULATION`-only instrumentation and never entered a bitstream, so the
only mission change ever measured on hardware is Phase B (row below).

Ratio columns are Speedometer's own: CPU tests are Mac Classic = 1.0, color
tests are Mac II = 1.0. Higher is better for KWhetstones/Dhrystones and for
every `(Rat.)` column; lower is better for every `(sec)` column.

## ★★★ I-cache with the hit-silent bus (2026-08-19) — 97.0% of a real Mac LC

Measured on hardware 2026-08-19 by the user, RBF md5
`65332d3b736756199d7c4c8351276bde` (= `releases/MacLC_20260819.rbf`, seed 4,
STA +0.251), 1 KB direct-mapped I-cache ALWAYS ON, hits bus-silent
(`hit_now` request gate, commit 7a49327).

| Suite | cache-off (B+C) | cache, stalled (5db08dda) | **cache, hit-silent** | vs cache-off | share of a real LC |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Benchmark Mix | 3.067 | 3.273 | **3.591** | **+17.1%** | 82.8% → **97.0%** |
| Color Benchmarks | 1.030 | 1.061 | **1.179** | **+14.5%** | 82.5% → **94.4%** |

**Six of twelve Mix tests now BEAT the physical Mac LC**: KWhetstones
(5.020 vs 4.784), Dhrystones (2.954 vs 2.359), Towers (2.930 vs 2.337),
Fast Fourier (3.387 vs 3.291), F.P. Matrix (3.460 vs 3.300), Int Matrix
(4.924 vs 4.554). Quick Sort is at parity (3.344 vs 3.366). The residual
gap is concentrated in Sieve (4.297 vs 6.357, 67.6%) and Queens (2.862 vs
3.319, 86.2%) — loops whose working set defeats a 1 KB word-granular
direct-mapped cache where the real '020's line-filled 256 B cache +
prefetch overlap still wins.

**The stalled intermediate row matters historically**: the first cache-on
measurement (5db08dda) showed the software-FP tests 4-6% BELOW cache-off —
every hit abandoned its already-launched demand transaction and the next
access stalled behind the phantom. The hit-silent gate (a hit never starts
a transaction) recovered them past the physical machine. Per-test
fingerprint of that class, for the future: tight loops up, FP/data-heavy
down, in the same run.

## ★ Phase B+C (demand-start SDRAM, branch `cpu-phase-c-fix`) — +10.7%

Measured on hardware 2026-08-18, same bench/guest/config, RBF md5
`b9ed35136d5ef2994589d6a77bb64088` (seed 4, STA met +0.149 ns).

| Suite | Baseline | Phase B | **Phase B+C** | vs baseline | share of a real Mac LC |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Benchmark Mix | 2.771 | 2.756 | **3.067** | **+10.7%** | 74.9% → **82.8%** |
| Color Benchmarks | 0.937 | 0.935 | **1.030** | **+9.9%** | 75.0% → **82.5%** |

**Every single test improved** (+6.6% to +17.5%), and the prediction held: the
bus-cycle histogram forecast ~+12% cycles/sec, the mix measured **+11.3%** over
Phase B. Cycle lengths went completely flat (100% of fetches at exactly 8
ticks) instead of the baseline's 75%-at-8 with the rest paying 10/12/14 for
slot misalignment.

Two tests now BEAT a physical Mac LC — Dhrystones 109.5% and Towers 106.8% —
and 8-bit colour (1.115) is past a Mac II. Floating point sits at ~95%.

**Where the remaining ~17% lives — exactly where the mission's opening
analysis predicted.** The worst tests are still the tight-loop ones that fit
inside a real 68020's 256-byte on-chip instruction cache, which this core does
not have:

| test | share of a real Mac LC |
|:--|--:|
| Sieve | 53.7% |
| Queens | 72.3% |
| Bubble Sort | 74.4% |
| Puzzle | 76.8% |

That is the I-cache deficit, not the bus — the bus work is done. Ladder item 3
(`rtl/fetch_cache.sv` on branch `i-cache`, shadow-measured at 87.7% hit at
256 B / 96.0% at 1 KB) is now the single dominant remaining item, and it
targets precisely these tests. Note it must be re-evaluated against the NEW
7-tick-flat memory path, not the old 8-14 tick one.

## Phase B (collapsed bus FSM, commit 2791e6a) — NO measurable change

Measured on hardware 2026-08-18, same bench/guest/config as the baseline row.

| Suite | Baseline (08-17) | Phase B (08-18) | change |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
| Benchmark Mix | 2.771 | 2.756 | -0.54% |
| Color Benchmarks | 0.937 | 0.935 | -0.21% |

Every individual test lands within +0.07% / -1.71%, i.e. **run-to-run noise**
(all tests ran at Itr. = 1). **This confirms the Step-0 model rather than
contradicting it.** The bus-cycle histogram predicted exactly this: Phase B
shortens the CPU's state machine, but RAM/ROM/VRAM still took DTACK only at
cpu-slot starts, so memory cycles stayed pinned at the mod-4 slot floor
(sim: ROM fetch 8.93 ticks before AND after; the boot executed
cycle-for-cycle identically, 2,944,491 vs 2,944,483 cycles). Phase B's gains
were confined to the immediate-DTACK paths (IO 5 ticks, RAM writes 6), which
are a negligible share of traffic.

**The entire win lives in Phase C** (demand-start SDRAM, which breaks the
slot quantization: reads 8→7 ticks flat, writes→6, +25.4% cycles/sec in sim)
— currently blocked on the hardware corruption bug documented in
`docs/CPU_Perf_Resume_2026-08-18.md`. Phase B remains a necessary
prerequisite, not a win in itself.

**Side benefit — the frozen-menubar-clock worry is settled for benchmarking:**
these absolute times match the baseline within 0.5%, so the 60 Hz
TickCount/Time Manager path (`tick_60hz` → VIA1 CA1) is demonstrably healthy.
Only the 1 Hz time-of-day path (`onesec` → CA2) is suspect, and it does not
feed Speedometer.

## Headline: the core runs at ~75% of a real Mac LC

| Suite                          | Core  | Physical Mac LC | Core / real LC |
|:-------------------------------|------:|----------------:|---------------:|
| Benchmark Mix (Classic = 1.0)  | 2.771 |           3.702 |         74.8% |
| Color Benchmarks (Mac II = 1.0)| 0.937 |           1.249 |         75.0% |

Both suites land within 0.2 points of each other — the deficit is uniform, not
a video-only or CPU-only artifact. For scale against the rest of the reference
set: physical Mac LC II and Mac II are 1.61x and 1.62x the core's CPU mix, and
the Performa 600 is 2.58x.

## Per-test gap to a physical Mac LC (640x480)

Core time ÷ physical time; rate tests (KWhetstones, Dhrystones) inverted so
that ">1x slower" always means the core is behind.

| Test          |   Core | Mac LC | Core is |
|:--------------|-------:|-------:|--------:|
| Sieve         | 11.017 |  4.900 | **2.25x slower** |
| Queens        |  3.467 |  2.300 |  1.51x slower |
| Bubble Sort   |  4.850 |  3.250 |  1.49x slower |
| Puzzle        |  8.600 |  6.183 |  1.39x slower |
| Permutations  |  8.367 |  6.117 |  1.37x slower |
| Quick Sort    |  3.433 |  2.550 |  1.35x slower |
| Int. Matrix   |  3.867 |  3.100 |  1.25x slower |
| Fast Fourier  | 68.583 | 59.467 |  1.15x slower |
| KWhetstones/s | 30.303 | 34.924 |  1.15x slower |
| F.P. Matrix   | 37.433 | 32.767 |  1.14x slower |
| Dhrystones/s  |2252.252|2298.850|  1.02x slower (par) |
| Towers        |  4.517 |  4.450 |  1.02x slower (par) |
| Monochrome    | 38.900 | 28.733 |  1.35x slower |
| Two Bit       | 43.000 | 31.817 |  1.35x slower |
| Four Bit      | 46.733 | 35.183 |  1.33x slower |
| Eight Bit     | 55.267 | 42.433 |  1.30x slower |

## Reading of the shape

- **The deficit is concentrated in tight-loop tests.** Sieve (2.25x), Queens
  (1.51x) and Bubble Sort (1.49x) are the three whose inner loops are small
  enough to sit entirely inside a real 68020's 256-byte on-chip instruction
  cache — which the core does not have. Sieve is the extreme case and is the
  single worst test on the sheet.
- **Call-heavy and library-heavy code is already at parity**: Dhrystones and
  Towers are 1.02x, i.e. within run-to-run noise of the real machine. Where
  the working set is too big for a real LC's I-cache to help, the core keeps up.
- **Floating point sits mid-pack at ~1.15x** (Whetstone, FFT, F.P. Matrix).
  Both machines are FPU-less, so this is the SANE software path and it tracks
  the general bus tax rather than any FP-specific defect.
- **QuickDraw is a flat ~1.30–1.35x across all four depths.** Flatness across
  bit depth points at per-access cost, not pixel volume — and it matches the
  CPU-side average almost exactly, consistent with a single shared cause
  (instruction-fetch latency) rather than two independent ones.

The 2026-07-07 fetch-cache measurement session reached the same conclusion
from the other direction: instruction fetches were 43% of wall time at ~6.15
clk_sys each, and a shadow model on the live fetch stream hit 87.7% at 256 B /
96.0% at 1 KB. See `docs/resume_icache_corruption_2026-07-07.md` on branch
`i-cache` (module `rtl/fetch_cache.sv`), which is parked on a disk-corruption
blocker.
